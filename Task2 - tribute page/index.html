                <h3><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3> <br>
                <p>Narendra Modi grew up in the town of Vadnagar in India, the son of a street merchant. He entered
                    politics as a youth and quickly rose through the ranks of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu
                    nationalist political party. Modi later joined the mainstream Bharatiya Janata Party in 1987,
                    eventually becoming national secretary. In 2002, he was alleged to be responsible for the deaths of
                    more than 1,000 Muslims during civil unrest but was later exonerated. In 2014 he was elected prime
                    minister of India.</p> <br> <br>

                <h3><strong>Background</strong></h3> <br>
                <p>Narendra Modi was born in the small town of Vadnagar, in northern Gujarat, India. His father was a
                    street merchant who struggled to support the family. Young Narendra and his brother sold tea near a
                    bus terminal to help out. Though an average student in school, Modi spent hours in the library and
                    was known as a strong debater. In his early teens, he joined Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the
                    student wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist political party. </p> <br><br>

                <h3><strong>Life Dedicated to Politics</strong></h3> <br>
                <p>Modi had an arranged married at 18 but spent little time with his bride. The two eventually
                    separated, with Modi claiming to be single for some time. He dedicated his life to politics in
                    Gujarat, joining the RSS in 1971. During the 1975-77 political crisis, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
                    declared a state of emergency, banning political organizations such as the RSS. Modi went
                    underground and wrote a book, Sangharsh ma Gujarat (Gujarat in Emergency), which chronicles his
                    experiences as a political fugitive. In 1978, Modi graduated from Delhi University with a degree in
                    political science and completed his master’s work at Gujarat University in 1983.</p>
                <p>In 1987, Narendra Modi joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which stood for Hindu nationalism.
                    His rise through the ranks was rapid, as he wisely chose mentors to further his career. He promoted
                    privatization of businesses, small government and Hindu values. In 1995, Modi was elected BJP
                    national secretary, a position from which he successfully helped settle internal leadership
                    disputes, paving the way for BJP election victories in 1998.</p> <br><br>

                <h3><strong>Elected Prime Minister</strong></h3>  <br>

                <p>In June 2013, Modi was selected to head the BJP’s 2014 election campaign to the Lok Sabha (the lower
                    house of India’s parliament), while a grassroots campaign was already in place to elect him prime
                    minister. Modi campaigned hard, portraying himself as a pragmatic candidate capable of turning
                    around India’s economy, while his critics portrayed him as a controversial and divisive figure. In
                    May 2014, he and his party were victorious, taking 282 of the 534 seats in the Lok Sabha. The
                    victory marked a crushing defeat to the Indian National Congress, which had controlled country
                    politics for most of the previous 60 years, and sent a message that India’s citizens were behind an
                    agenda that moved away from a secular, socialist state to a more capitalist-leaning economy with
                    Hindu nationalism at its core.</p>
                <p>On May 26, 2014 Modi was sworn in as the 14th prime minister of India and the first to have been born
                    after the country got its independence from the U.K.</p> <br><br>

                <h3><strong>Policy</strong></h3> <br>
                <p>Since becoming prime minister, Modi has encouraged foreign businesses to invest in India. He has
                    lifted various regulations - permits and inspections - so that businesses could grow more easily. He
                    has decreased spending on social welfare programs and has encouraged the privatization of
                    healthcare, although he has devised a policy on universal healthcare for those citizens with serious
                    ailments. In 2014 he launched a "Clean India" campaign, which focused on sanitation and the
                    construction of millions of toilets in rural areas. </p>
                <p>His environment policies have been lax, especially when those policies hamper industrial growth. He
                    has lifted restrictions on protecting the environment and is more open to the use of genetically
                    modified crops, despite protests from India's farmers. Under Modi's power, he has suppressed the
                    influence of civil society organizations, such as Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Avaaz, and other
                    humanitarian groups, citing they prevent economic growth.</p>
                <p>In terms of foreign policy, Modi has taken on a multilateral approach. He has participated in the
                    BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits, as well as aligned himself with the United States, China, Japan and
                    Russia to improve economic and political ties. He has also reached out to Islamic republics, most
                    notably fostering diplomatic ties with Pakistan, although he has repeatedly labeled the country a
                    "terrorist state" and an "exporter of terrorism."</p>
                <p>Under his rule, Modi has substantially centralized his power compared to previous administrations.

                <h3><strong>Global Recognition</strong></h3> <br>

                <p>In 2016 Modi won the reader's poll as TIME's Person of the Year. In previous years, he had received
                    top ranking as one of the most influential political figures in the world in both TIME and Forbes
                    Magazine. He is only second to President Obama for having the most social media followers as a
                    political figure. With high favorability ratings among Indian voters, Modi has a reputation for
                    actively engaging citizens through social media and encouraging his own administration to stay
                    active on its platforms.
